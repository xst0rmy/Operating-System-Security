# Operating-System-Security
This is a brief summary of the CIA triad.

I'm going to talk about the factors that are used to determine the security of data.


At every point in time, you want to ensure that data that is on a network is secured. Which leads me to talk about the CIA which are factors used to ensure that data are protected at all time.

The CIA triad stands for:
### Confidentiality
### Integrity
### Availability 

You want to always make sure that this criterias are met at all times.

So what do they really mean and how useful or needed are they?

I'll explain each principle accordingly 

## 1. Confidentiality: This principle ensures that files and informations are ONLY available to the intended recipients. This makes it possible for the right authority to access an information. For example, a receptionist in an organisation should not be able to access the salary information of the employees.

## 2. Integrity: This principle ensure that files and information on a network or device cannot be tampered with either while it's in your system or while being transferred on a network. A limitation to this principle is when a Man-in-the-middle attack is ongoing, whatever data that is sent over the network lacks integrity as the hacker may have tampered with the file.

## 3. Availability: This principle ensure that information on a network or device is always accessible whenever it's needed. A limitation to this principle is when a hacker performs a ransomeware attack (encrypts a system and demands a ransom before the system is decrypted).
